          <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
          <p>During Summer 2019 I interned with Google on the Assistant Team in Mountain View, CA.
              My project consisted of implementing suggestion chips for app actions within the Google 
              Assistant. I used C++, set up configs, and wrote unit tests for my code. This was such a valuable
              experience and my takeaways were so much more than just technical information. I got to meet 
              and talk with so many SWE's and professionals that forever have a lasting impact on me.

          <h2>Career Goals</h2>
          <p>I aspire to graduate with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in 2022, and to 
              pursue a career in Software Engineering that aligns with my studies. I'm using my internship
              experience to really discover which areas in Computer Science that I want to 
              focus on to start my career in the industry.
