      <h2>Hidden Talents</h2>
      <p>I have always been the quiet type, and I've never really liked being in a huge spotlight. 
          So, I surprised everyone, including myself, last year when I wrote my first song, recorded it, and released it to SoundCloud. It wasn't surprising to me
          that I had the technical abilities to figure out how to use Garageband to produce and record. It wasnt even surprising to me that my song had a catchy tune; I've been 
          singing my whole life, really. It was surprising because I finally let my pent-up creativity flow freely and put it out there for the world to see, 
          after a lifetime of putting it on the back burner. </p>
