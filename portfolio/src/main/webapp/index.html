      <h2> What makes me, me?</h2>
      <p>I'm a driven individual, and I enjoy thinking outside of the box to solve problems and 
          to put my creative imprint into my projects and hobbies. I'm very detail oriented, and
          I like to exceed the standards set for me academically and professionally. I'm always
          looking to learn something new to better myself, and increase my knowledge.
          I like to encourage those who are younger than me and give them advice that helps them to 
          accomplish their goals.</p>

          <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
          <p>During Summer 2019 I interned with Google on the Assistant Team in Mountain View, CA.
              My project consisted of implementing suggestion chips for app actions within the Google 
              Assistant. I used C++, set up configs, and wrote unit tests for my code. This was such a valuable
              experience and my takeaways were so much more than just technical information. I got to meet 
              and talk with so many SWE's and professionals that forever have a lasting impact on me.

          <h2>Career Goals</h2>
          <p>I aspire to graduate with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in 2022, and to 
              pursue a career in Software Engineering that aligns with my studies. I'm using my internship
              experience to really discover which areas in Computer Science that I want to 
              focus on to start my career in the industry.

      <h2>Comp Sci Courses I've Taken</h2>
      <ul style= "list-style-type:none;">
        <div class = "center2">
          <li>Intro to Computer Programming</li>
          <li>Computer Programming Design</li>
          <li>Discrete Structures</li>
          <li>Data Structures</li>
          <li>Analysis of Algorithms</li>
        </div>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hidden Talents</h2>
      <p>I have always been the quiet type, and I've never really liked being in a huge spotlight. 
          So, I surprised everyone, including myself, last year when I wrote my first song, recorded it, and released it to SoundCloud. It wasn't surprising to me
          that I had the technical abilities to figure out how to use Garageband to produce and record. It wasn't even surprising to me that my song had a catchy tune; I've been 
          singing my whole life, really. It was surprising because I finally let my pent-up creativity flow freely and put it out there for the world to see, 
          after a lifetime of putting it on the back burner. My first song accumulated a few thousand listens
          after a week or two, and that was excting to see that I had the ability to reach people in my own way. </p>

      <p>I also really enjoy editing and superimposing pictures, and making graphics. It fascinates me that technology
          gives me so much freedom to create. Whenever I finish a new song, its so fun for me to create the cover artwork,
          lyric videos, and all the promo content to post on my social media accounts. </p>
