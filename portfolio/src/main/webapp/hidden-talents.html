      <h2>Hidden Talents</h2>
      <p>I have always been the quiet type, and I've never really liked being in a huge spotlight. 
          So, I surprised everyone, including myself, last year when I wrote my first song, recorded it, and released it to SoundCloud. It wasn't surprising to me
          that I had the technical abilities to figure out how to use Garageband to produce and record. It wasn't even surprising to me that my song had a catchy tune; I've been 
          singing my whole life, really. It was surprising because I finally let my pent-up creativity flow freely and put it out there for the world to see, 
          after a lifetime of putting it on the back burner. My first song accumulated a few thousand listens
          after a week or two, and that was excting to see that I had the ability to reach people in my own way. </p>

      <p>I also really enjoy editing and superimposing pictures, and making graphics. It fascinates me that technology
          gives me so much freedom to create. Whenever I finish a new song, its so fun for me to create the cover artwork,
          lyric videos, and all the promo content to post on my social media accounts. </p>
