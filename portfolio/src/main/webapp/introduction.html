      <h2> What makes me, me?</h2>
      <p>I'm a driven individual, and I enjoy thinking outside of the box to solve problems and 
          to put my creative imprint into my projects and hobbies. I'm very detail oriented, and
          I like to exceed the standards set for me academically and professionally. I'm always
          looking to learn something new to better myself, and increase my knowledge.
          I like to encourage those who are younger than me and give them advice that helps them to 
          accomplish their goals.</p>
